This project was completed for the course "Microcomputer Technology" during the winter semester 2022.

In a team of four, we developed a C-Program to play Conway's game of life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on a playing field of configurable size and cell distribution.

My main task was developing the 'engine' module, though I also suported other students with the graphics- implementation and the module compilation in the main.c file.
